## Workflow

Please follow the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) for contributions:

1. **Update your local main branch**

   Switch to your main branch and pull the latest changes from the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git switch main
   git pull --prune
   ```

   - The `--prune` option removes any references to branches that no longer exist on the remote.

2. **Create a new branch**

   Name your branch following the convention `issue-number` (e.g., `issue-1`):

   ```bash
   git switch -c <issue-number> main
   ```

   - If no issue exists for the change you are making, please [create one](https://github.com/tabletop-generator/client/issues/new/choose).

3. **Make your changes**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test your changes**

   Run the following checks to ensure everything works as expected:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

5. **Review your changes**

   Check which files have been changed:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

6. **Stage your changes**

   Add the relevant files to staging:

   ```bash
   git add <files>
   ```

7. **Commit your changes**

   Write a meaningful commit message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "<commit message>"
   ```

8. **Push your branch**

   Push your changes and set the upstream branch:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

9. **Create a pull request**
